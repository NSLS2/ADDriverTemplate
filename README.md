# ADDriverTemplate

This repository contains a pre-organized file structure for writing areaDetector drivers.
To use it, start by installing the `cookiecutter` utility. The simplest way to do this is to use `pip`:

```
pip3 install --user cookiecutter
```

Next, simply run cookiecutter with the url to this repository as an argument:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/jwlodek/ADDriverTempalate
```

Follow the prompts, and you should have all the base files and directories for a new driver created!
